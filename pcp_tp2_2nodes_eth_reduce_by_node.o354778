on the node. In some Linux distributions, the required support is
contained in the libnumactl and libnumactl-devel packages.

A request was made to bind to that would result in binding more
processes than cpus on a resource:

   Bind to:     CORE
   Node:        compute-641-20
   #processes:  2
   #cpus:       1

You can override this protection by adding the "overload-allowed"
option to your binding directive.
